### Launch the Application from PowerShell

1. Ensure your Pixel emulator is running and fully booted.
2. In PowerShell, navigate to the project's root directory (`c:\Dev\tp3-mobile`).
3. Run the following command to build and deploy the app:

   ```powershell
   dotnet run
   ```

4. Monitor the terminal output. Once the build succeeds, the application should launch on the connected emulator.
